# Video Content Guidelines

## YouTube Visibility: Unlisted

For video link protection and to minimize sharing outside the app, all paid videos (and optionally free videos) should be uploaded as **Unlisted** in YouTube Studio.

- **Unlisted** videos do not appear in YouTube search results or on your channel
- They can only be played via direct link or embed
- This reduces the chance of unauthorized access when combined with backend-gated embed URLs

To set a video as Unlisted:

1. Go to [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com)
2. Select the video
3. Under **Visibility**, choose **Unlisted**

This is a content-owner responsibility; no code changes are required.
